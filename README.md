# screeps-mongo

For best results, run `screeps init` in /screeps and place this in /screeps/screeps-mongo
Run init.sh to quickly install all node modules (Assumes Docker is installed and uses node:6)

## Note:
This is a non-cleaned up copy with several hard-coded paths and a lack of proper package.json setup. 
Manual work will most likely be needed to make it run.
